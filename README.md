# Rugby World Cup 2023 France Gallery

## Description
This project showcases a collection of images captured during my time in France for the Rugby World Cup 2023. I've created a dynamic and immersive image gallery experience, using Next.js. 

Disclaimer - this project was not built for mobile use. In every project I've done, I've always built with a mobile-first approach, however for this specific project I wanted it be to laptop/desktop only, because of the scroll animations implemented.

## Features
- **Image Gallery:** Explore a curated selection of photographs capturing memorable moments from the Rugby World Cup 2023 in France.
- **Immersive Experience:** Users can immerse themselves in the photos with sclaing and a vignette animation. Get a feel for what I witnessed, through the selection of photos.

4. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
